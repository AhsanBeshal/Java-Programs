This project should be launched from Input class first!

This is a project that simulates a bank’s atm machine. It uses database to hold all the customers and all of their informations. When launched, it will use a JFrame
to display series of texts along with an input field. After that it will use another
JFrame to display the customer’s information. It will give the customer 3 options, Deposit, Withdraw, Exit. Depending on what the customer selects it will launch that specific class and execute whatever is on that class. After that it will display a final JFrame which will display the receipt.
