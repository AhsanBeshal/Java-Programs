This project should be launched from Input class first!
  
This project represents UPS's delivery system. When it is launched it will ask the user/driver for 3 inputs. 

First the city the driver is currently in, then it will ask for his location (x and y). After that those inputs will be used in Results class to figure out nearest delivery depending on driver's input. There will be 3 time frames. 5 min, 10 min and
15 min, if the delivery is within those time frames then it will show the receiver's information along with the time frame.
